# Marketing

Direct mailings to a company’s potential customers – “junk mail” to many – can be a very effective way for them to market a product or a service. However, as we all know, much of this junk mail is really of no interest to the people that receive it. Most of it ends up thrown away, not only wasting the money that the company spent on it, but also filling up landfill waste sites or needing to be recycled. If the company had a better understanding of who their potential customers were, they would know more accurately who to send it to, so some of this waste and expense could be reduced.

**Problem Statement:**
The client wants us to predict whether a customer is interested in a caravan insurance policy from other data about the customer. Information about customers consists of 86 variables and includes product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip area codes. The data was supplied based on a real world business problem. The training set contains over 5000
descriptions of customers, including the information of whether or not they have a caravan
insurance policy. A test set contains 4000 customers of whom target variable is not shared with
us.

**Solution:**
For the given train and test data processing, handling missing values is done. Used train dataset for building the decision tree model to predict outcome for the given test data. The accuracy of the model came to be 80%. Accuracy and precision also calculated. Expected outcomes are in either 0 or 1. The output file is provided in the csv format.
